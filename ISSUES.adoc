== Build

Race condition on test - seeing in **consumer** module because sql files to create schema and aggregate_root table is are not executed.

Instead of using the generated **compose-devservices-pulse.yml** docker compose file it will start a **dev service redpanda** and a **dev service postgres**.

If it fails this message will be found in log:
